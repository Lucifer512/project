       "  'In Ginsberg\\'s freshman year at Columbia he met fellow undergraduate Lucien Carr, who introduced him to a number of future Beat writers, including Jack Kerouac, William S. Burroughs, and John Clellon Holmes. They bonded because they saw in one another an excitement about the potential of American youth, a potential that existed outside the strict conformist confines of postâ\\x80\\x93World War II, McCarthy-era America. Ginsberg and Carr talked excitedly about a \"New Vision\" (a phrase adapted from Arthur Rimbaud) for literature and America. Carr also introduced Ginsberg to Neal Cassady, for whom Ginsberg had a long infatuation. Barry Gifford, ed., As Ever: The Collected Correspondence of Allen Ginsberg & Neal Cassady. In the first chapter of his 1957 novel On the Road Kerouac described the meeting between Ginsberg and Cassady. Kerouac saw them as the dark (Ginsberg) and light (Cassady) side of their \"New Vision\", a perception stemming partly from Ginsberg\\'s association with communism, of which Kerouac had become increasingly distrustful. Though Ginsberg was never a member of the Communist Party, Kerouac named him \"Carlo Marx\" in On the Road. This was a source of strain in their relationship. \\n',\n",

       "  'Also, in New York, Ginsberg met Gregory Corso in the Pony Stable Bar. Corso, recently released from prison, was supported by the Pony Stable patrons and was writing poetry there the night of their meeting. Ginsberg claims he was immediately attracted to Corso, who was straight, but understanding of homosexuality after three years in prison. Ginsberg was even more struck by reading Corso\\'s poems, realizing Corso was \"spiritually gifted.\" Ginsberg introduced Corso to the rest of his inner circle. In their first meeting at the Pony Stable, Corso showed Ginsberg a poem about a woman who lived across the street from him and sunbathed naked in the window. Amazingly, the woman happened to be Ginsberg\\'s girlfriend that he was living with during one of his forays into heterosexuality. Ginsberg took Corso over to their apartment. There the woman proposed sex with Corso, who was still very young and fled in fear. Ginsberg introduced Corso to Kerouac and Burroughs and they began to travel together. Ginsberg and Corso remained lifelong friends and collaborators. \\n',\n",

       "  'Shortly after this period in Ginsberg\\'s life, he became romantically involved with Elise Nada Cowen after meeting her through Alex Greer, a philosophy professor at Barnard College whom she had dated for a while during the burgeoning Beat generation\\'s period of development. As a Barnard student, Elise Cowen extensively read the poetry of Ezra Pound and T.S. Eliot, when she met Joyce Johnson and Leo Skir, among other Beat players. As Cowen had felt a strong attraction to darker poetry most of the time, Beat poetry seemed to provide an allure to what suggests a shadowy side of her persona. While at Barnard, Cowen earned the nickname \"Beat Alice\" as she had joined a small group of anti-establishment artists and visionaries known to outsiders as beatniks, and one of her first acquaintances at the college was the beat poet Joyce Johnson who later portrayed Cowen in her books, including \"Minor Characters\" and Come and Join the Dance, which expressed the two women\\'s experiences in the Barnard and Columbia Beat community. Through his association with Elise Cowen, Ginsberg discovered that they shared a mutual friend, Carl Solomon, to whom he later dedicated his most famous poem \"Howl\". This poem is considered an autobiography of Ginsberg up to 1955, and a brief history of the Beat Generation through its references to his relationship to other Beat artists of that time.\\n',\n",

       "  'In 1948 in an apartment in Harlem, Ginsberg had an auditory hallucination while reading the poetry of William Blake (later referred to as his \"Blake vision\"). At first, Ginsberg claimed to have heard the voice of God, but later interpreted the voice as that of Blake himself reading Ah, Sunflower, The Sick Rose, and Little Girl Lost, also described by Ginsberg as \"voice of the ancient of days\". The experience lasted several days. Ginsberg believed that he had witnessed the interconnectedness of the universe. He looked at lattice-work on the fire escape and realized some hand had crafted that; he then looked at the sky and intuited that some hand had crafted that also, or rather, that the sky was the hand that crafted itself. He explained that this hallucination was not inspired by drug use, but said he sought to recapture that feeling later with various drugs. Ginsberg stated: \"living blue hand itself xistence itself was God\" and \" felt a sudden awakening into a totally deeper real universe.\"\\n',\n",

There, Ginsberg also met three budding poets and Zen enthusiasts who had become friends at Reed College: Gary Snyder, Philip Whalen, and Lew Welch.

At first, Ginsberg refused, but once he had written a rough draft of \"Howl\", he changed his \"fucking mind\", as he put it. Ginsberg advertised the event as \"Six Poets at the Six Gallery\". One of the most important events in Beat mythos, known simply as \"The Six Gallery reading\" took place on October 7, 1955. The event, in essence, brought together the East and West Coast factions of the Beat Generation. Of more personal significance to Ginsberg, the reading that night included the first public presentation of \"Howl\", a poem that brought worldwide fame to Ginsberg and to many of the poets associated with him. An account of that night can be found in Kerouac\\'s novel The Dharma Bums, describing how change was collected from audience members to buy jugs of wine, and Ginsberg reading passionately, drunken, with arms outstretched.\\n',\n",

       "  'Ginsberg\\'s principal work, \"Howl\", is well known for its opening line: \"I saw the best minds of my generation destroyed by madness, starving hysterical naked....\" \"Howl\" was considered scandalous at the time of its publication, because of the rawness of its language. Shortly after its 1956 publication by San Francisco\\'s City Lights Bookstore, it was banned for obscenity. The ban became a cause cÃ©lÃ¨bre among defenders of the First Amendment, and was later lifted, after Judge Clayton W. Horn declared the poem to possess redeeming artistic value. Ginsberg and Shig Murao, the City Lights manager who was jailed for selling \"Howl,\" became lifelong friends.

       "  '====Biographical references in \"Howl\"====\\n',\n",
       "  'Ginsberg claimed at one point that all of his work was an extended biography (like Kerouac\\'s Duluoz Legend). \"Howl\" is not only a biography of Ginsberg\\'s experiences before 1955, but also a history of the Beat Generation. Ginsberg also later claimed that at the core of \"Howl\" were his unresolved emotions about his schizophrenic mother. Though \"Kaddish\" deals more explicitly with his mother (so explicitly that a line-by-line analysis would be simultaneously over-exhaustive and relatively unrevealing), \"Howl\" in many ways is driven by the same emotions. \"Howl\" chronicles the development of many important friendships throughout Ginsbergâ\\x80\\x99s life. He begins the poem with â\\x80\\x9cI saw the best minds of my generation destroyed by madnessâ\\x80\\x9d, which sets the stage for Ginsberg to describe Cassady and Solomon, immortalizing them into American literature. This madness was the â\\x80\\x9cangry fixâ\\x80\\x9d that society needed to functionâ\\x80\\x94madness was its disease. In the poem, Ginsberg focused on â\\x80\\x9cCarl Solomon! Iâ\\x80\\x99m with you in Rocklandâ\\x80\\x9d, and, thus, turned Solomon into an archetypal figure searching for freedom from his â\\x80\\x9cstraightjacketâ\\x80\\x9d. Though references in most of his poetry reveal much about his biography, his relationship to other members of the Beat Generation, and his own political views, \"Howl\", his most famous poem, is still perhaps the best place to start.\\n',\n",

Corso introduced them to a shabby lodging house above a bar at 9 rue GÃ®t-le-Coeur that was to become known as the Beat Hotel. They were soon joined by Burroughs and others. It was a productive, creative time for all of them. There, Ginsberg finished his epic poem \"Kaddish\", Corso composed Bomb and Marriage, and Burroughs (with help from Ginsberg and Corso) put together Naked Lunch, from previous writings. This period was documented by the photographer Harold Chapman, who moved in at about the same time, and took pictures constantly of the residents of the \"hotel\" until it closed in 1963. During 1962â\\x80\\x933, Ginsberg and Orlovsky travelled extensively across India, living half a year at a time in Benaras and Calcutta. Also during this time, he formed friendships with some of the prominent young Bengali poets of the time including Shakti Chattopadhyay and Sunil Gangopadhyay.

A key feature of this term seems to be a friendship with Ginsberg. Friendship with Kerouac or Burroughs might also apply, but both writers later strove to disassociate themselves from the name \"Beat Generation.\" Part of their dissatisfaction with the term came from the mistaken identification of Ginsberg as the leader.

       "  'On January 17, 1967, Allen Ginsberg helped plan and organize a reception for Bhaktivedanta Swami at the San Francisco Airport, where fifty to a hundred hippies greeted the Swami, chanting Hare Krishna in the airport lounge with flowers in hands. Addressing speculations that he was Allen Ginsberg\\'s guru, Bhaktivedanta Swami answered a direct question in a public program, \"Are you Allen Ginsberg\\'s guru?\" by saying, \"I am nobodyâ\\x80\\x99s guru. I am everybodyâ\\x80\\x99s servant. Actually I am not even a servant; a servant of God is no ordinary thing.\" (; ) To further support and promote Bhaktivendata Swami\\'s message and chanting in San Francisco, Allen Ginsberg agreed to attend the Mantra-Rock Danceâ\\x80\\x94a musical event held at the Avalon Ballroom by the San Francisco Hare Krishna temple. It featured some leading rock bands of the time: Big Brother and the Holding Company with Janis Joplin, The Grateful Dead, and Moby Grape, who performed there along with the Hare Krishna founder Bhaktivedanta Swami and donated proceeds to the Krishna temple. Ginsberg introduced Bhaktivedanta Swami to some three thousand hippies in the audience and led the chanting of the Hare Krishna mantra. \\n',\n",

This is followed soon by the line \"with mother finally ******.\" Ginsberg later admitted the deletion was the expletive \"fucked.\" Original Draft p. 131. He also says of Solomon in section three, \"I\\\\\\'m with you in Rockland where you imitate the shade of my mother,\" once again showing the association between Solomon and his mother. Jonah Raskin, American Scream: Allen Ginsberg\\\\\\'s \"Howl\" and the Making of the Beat Generation, pp. 156â\\\\x80\\\\x93157. \\\\n\\', \\'\\\\n\\', \\'Ginsberg received a letter from his mother after her death responding to a copy of \"Howl\" he had sent her. It admonished Ginsberg to be good and stay away from drugs; she says, \"The key is in the window, the key is in the sunlight at the window â\\\\x80\\\\x93 I have the key â\\\\x80\\\\x93 Get married Allen don\\\\\\'t take drugs â\\\\x80\\\\x93 the key is in the bars, in the sunlight in the window\". Hyde, pp. 426â\\\\x80\\\\x93427. In a letter she wrote to Ginsberg\\\\\\'s brother Eugene, she said, \"God\\\\\\'s informers come to my bed, and God himself I saw in the sky. The sunshine showed too, a key on the side of the window for me to get out. The yellow of the sunshine, also showed the key on the side of the window.\" Morgan, Celebrate, pp. 219â\\\\x80\\\\x93220. These letters and the inability to perform the kaddish ceremony inspired Ginsberg to write \"Kaddish\" which makes references to many details from Naomi\\\\\\'s life, Ginsberg\\\\\\'s experiences with her, and the letter, including the lines \"the key is in the light\" and \"the key is in the window\". Allen Ginsberg. Kaddish and Other Poems. Volume 2, Issue 14 of The Pocket Poets series. City Lights Books, 1961. \\\\n\\', \\'\\\\n\\', \\'===New York Beats===\\\\n\\', \\'In Ginsberg\\\\\\'s freshman year at Columbia he met fellow undergraduate Lucien Carr, who introduced him to a number of future Beat writers, including Jack Kerouac, William S. Burroughs, and John Clellon Holmes. They bonded because they saw in one another an excitement about the potential of American youth, a potential that existed outside the strict conformist confines of postâ\\\\x80\\\\x93World War II, McCarthy-era America. Ginsberg and Carr talked excitedly about a \"New Vision\" (a phrase adapted from Arthur Rimbaud) for literature and America. Carr also introduced Ginsberg to Neal Cassady, for whom Ginsberg had a long infatuation. Barry Gifford, ed., As Ever: The Collected Correspondence of Allen Ginsberg & Neal Cassady. In the first chapter of his 1957 novel On the Road Kerouac described the meeting between Ginsberg and Cassady. Kerouac saw them as the dark (Ginsberg) and light (Cassady) side of their \"New Vision\", a perception stemming partly from Ginsberg\\\\\\'s association with communism, of which Kerouac had become increasingly distrustful. Though Ginsberg was never a member of the Communist Party, Kerouac named him \"Carlo Marx\" in On the Road. This was a source of strain in their relationship. \\\\n\\', \\'\\\\n\\', \\'Also, in New York, Ginsberg met Gregory Corso in the Pony Stable Bar. Corso, recently released from prison, was supported by the Pony Stable patrons and was writing poetry there the night of their meeting. Ginsberg claims he was immediately attracted to Corso, who was straight, but understanding of homosexuality after three years in prison. Ginsberg was even more struck by reading Corso\\\\\\'s poems, realizing Corso was \"spiritually gifted.\" Ginsberg introduced Corso to the rest of his inner circle. In their first meeting at the Pony Stable, Corso showed Ginsberg a poem about a woman who lived across the street from him and sunbathed naked in the window. Amazingly, the woman happened to be Ginsberg\\\\\\'s girlfriend that he was living with during one of his forays into heterosexuality. Ginsberg took Corso over to their apartment. There the woman proposed sex with Corso, who was still very young and fled in fear. Ginsberg introduced Corso to Kerouac and Burroughs and they began to travel together. Ginsberg and Corso remained lifelong friends and collaborators. \\\\n\\', \\'\\\\n\\', \\'Shortly after this period in Ginsberg\\\\\\'s life, he became romantically involved with Elise Nada Cowen after meeting her through Alex Greer, a philosophy professor at Barnard College whom she had dated for a while during the burgeoning Beat generation\\\\\\'s period of development. As a Barnard student, Elise Cowen extensively read the poetry of Ezra Pound and T.S. Eliot, when she met Joyce Johnson and Leo Skir, among other Beat players. As Cowen had felt a strong attraction to darker poetry most of the time, Beat poetry seemed to provide an allure to what suggests a shadowy side of her persona. While at Barnard, Cowen earned the nickname \"Beat Alice\" as she had joined a small group of anti-establishment artists and visionaries known to outsiders as beatniks, and one of her first acquaintances at the college was the beat poet Joyce Johnson who later portrayed Cowen in her books, including \"Minor Characters\" and Come and Join the Dance, which expressed the two women\\\\\\'s experiences in the Barnard and Columbia Beat community. Through his association with Elise Cowen, Ginsberg discovered that they shared a mutual friend, Carl Solomon, to whom he later dedicated his most famous poem \"Howl\". This poem is considered an autobiography of Ginsberg up to 1955, and a brief history of the Beat Generation through its references to his relationship to other Beat artists of that time.\\\\n\\', \\'\\\\n\\', \\'===The Blake Vision===\\\\n\\', \\'In 1948 in an apartment in Harlem, Ginsberg had an auditory hallucination while reading the poetry of William Blake (later referred to as his \"Blake vision\"). At first, Ginsberg claimed to have heard the voice of God, but later interpreted the voice as that of Blake himself reading Ah, Sunflower, The Sick Rose, and Little Girl Lost, also described by Ginsberg as \"voice of the ancient of days\". The experience lasted several days. Ginsberg believed that he had witnessed the interconnectedness of the universe. He looked at lattice-work on the fire escape and realized some hand had crafted that; he then looked at the sky and intuited that some hand had crafted that also, or rather, that the sky was the hand that crafted itself. He explained that this hallucination was not inspired by drug use, but said he sought to recapture that feeling later with various drugs. Ginsberg stated: \"living blue hand itself xistence itself was God\" and \" felt a sudden awakening into a totally deeper real universe.\"\\\\n\\', \\'\\\\n\\', \\'===San Francisco Renaissance===\\\\n\\', \\'In 1954, in San Francisco, Ginsberg met Peter Orlovsky (1933â\\\\x80\\\\x932010), with whom he fell in love and who remained his lifelong partner. \\\\n\\', \\'\\\\n\\', \"Also in San Francisco, Ginsberg met members of the San Francisco Renaissance and other poets who would later be associated with the Beat Generation in a broader sense. Ginsberg\\'s mentor William Carlos Williams wrote an introductory letter to San Francisco Renaissance figurehead Kenneth Rexroth, who then introduced Ginsberg into the San Francisco poetry scene. There, Ginsberg also met three budding poets and Zen enthusiasts who had become friends at Reed College: Gary Snyder, Philip Whalen, and Lew Welch. In 1959, along with poets John Kelly, Bob Kaufman, A. D. Winans, and William Margolis, Ginsberg was one of the founders of the Beatitude poetry magazine.\\\\n\", \\'\\\\n\\', \\'Wally Hedrick â\\\\x80\\\\x94 a painter and co-founder of the Six Gallery â\\\\x80\\\\x93 approached Ginsberg in mid-1955 and asked him to organize a poetry reading at the Six Gallery. At first, Ginsberg refused, but once he had written a rough draft of \"Howl\", he changed his \"fucking mind\", as he put it. Ginsberg advertised the event as \"Six Poets at the Six Gallery\". One of the most important events in Beat mythos, known simply as \"The Six Gallery reading\" took place on October 7, 1955. The event, in essence, brought together the East and West Coast factions of the Beat Generation. Of more personal significance to Ginsberg, the reading that night included the first public presentation of \"Howl\", a poem that brought worldwide fame to Ginsberg and to many of the poets associated with him. An account of that night can be found in Kerouac\\\\\\'s novel The Dharma Bums, describing how change was collected from audience members to buy jugs of wine, and Ginsberg reading passionately, drunken, with arms outstretched.\\\\n\\', \\'\\\\n\\', \\'Ginsberg\\\\\\'s principal work, \"Howl\", is well known for its opening line: \"I saw the best minds of my generation destroyed by madness, starving hysterical naked....\" \"Howl\" was considered scandalous at the time of its publication, because of the rawness of its language. Shortly after its 1956 publication by San Francisco\\\\\\'s City Lights Bookstore, it was banned for obscenity. The ban became a cause cÃ©lÃ¨bre among defenders of the First Amendment, and was later lifted, after Judge Clayton W. Horn declared the poem to possess redeeming artistic value. Ginsberg and Shig Murao, the City Lights manager who was jailed for selling \"Howl,\" became lifelong friends. Ball, Gordon, \"\\\\\\'Howl\\\\\\' and Other Victories: A friend remembers City Lights\\\\\\' Shig Murao,\" San Francisco Chronicle, 11/28/99. \\\\n\\', \\'\\\\n\\', \\'====Biographical references in \"Howl\"====\\\\n\\', \\'Ginsberg claimed at one point that all of his work was an extended biography (like Kerouac\\\\\\'s Duluoz Legend). \"Howl\" is not only a biography of Ginsberg\\\\\\'s experiences before 1955, but also a history of the Beat Generation. Ginsberg also later claimed that at the core of \"Howl\" were his unresolved emotions about his schizophrenic mother. Though \"Kaddish\" deals more explicitly with his mother (so explicitly that a line-by-line analysis would be simultaneously over-exhaustive and relatively unrevealing), \"Howl\" in many ways is driven by the same emotions. \"Howl\" chronicles the development of many important friendships throughout Ginsbergâ\\\\x80\\\\x99s life. He begins the poem with â\\\\x80\\\\x9cI saw the best minds of my generation destroyed by madnessâ\\\\x80\\\\x9d, which sets the stage for Ginsberg to describe Cassady and Solomon, immortalizing them into American literature. This madness was the â\\\\x80\\\\x9cangry fixâ\\\\x80\\\\x9d that society needed to functionâ\\\\x80\\\\x94madness was its disease. In the poem, Ginsberg focused on â\\\\x80\\\\x9cCarl Solomon! Iâ\\\\x80\\\\x99m with you in Rocklandâ\\\\x80\\\\x9d, and, thus, turned Solomon into an archetypal figure searching for freedom from his â\\\\x80\\\\x9cstraightjacketâ\\\\x80\\\\x9d. Though references in most of his poetry reveal much about his biography, his relationship to other members of the Beat Generation, and his own political views, \"Howl\", his most famous poem, is still perhaps the best place to start.\\\\n\\', \\'\\\\n\\', \\'===To Paris and the \"Beat Hotel\"===\\\\n\\', \\'In 1957, Ginsberg surprised the literary world by abandoning San Francisco. After a spell in Morocco, he and Peter Orlovsky joined Gregory Corso in Paris. Corso introduced them to a shabby lodging house above a bar at 9 rue GÃ®t-le-Coeur that was to become known as the Beat Hotel. They were soon joined by Burroughs and others. It was a productive, creative time for all of them. There, Ginsberg finished his epic poem \"Kaddish\", Corso composed Bomb and Marriage, and Burroughs (with help from Ginsberg and Corso) put together Naked Lunch, from previous writings. This period was documented by the photographer Harold Chapman, who moved in at about the same time, and took pictures constantly of the residents of the \"hotel\" until it closed in 1963. During 1962â\\\\x80\\\\x933, Ginsberg and Orlovsky travelled extensively across India, living half a year at a time in Benaras and Calcutta. Also during this time, he formed friendships with some of the prominent young Bengali poets of the time including Shakti Chattopadhyay and Sunil Gangopadhyay. He lived with the future President of India Pratibha Patil in Varanasi in 1962. Ginsberg had several political connections in India most notably Pupul Jayakar who helped him escape imprisonment during the Sino-Indian War.\\\\n\\', \\'\\\\n\\', \\'===England and the International Poetry Incarnation===\\\\n\\', \\'In May 1965, Allen Ginsberg arrived in London, and offered to read anywhere for free. Nuttall, J: Bomb Culture MacGibbon & Kee, 1968 ISBN 0-261-62617-5 Shortly after his arrival, he gave a reading at Better Books, which was described by Jeff Nuttall as \"the first healing wind on a very parched collective mind\". Tom McGrath wrote \"This could well turn out to have been a very significant moment in the history of England â\\\\x80\\\\x93 or at least in the history of English Poetry\". Fountain, N: Underground: the London alternative press, 1966â\\\\x80\\\\x9374 page 16. Taylor & Francis, 1988 ISBN 0-415-00728-3 \\\\n\\', \\'\\\\n\\', \\'Soon after the bookshop reading, plans were hatched for the International Poetry Incarnation, which was held at the Royal Albert Hall in London on June 11, 1965. The event attracted an audience of 7,000, who heard readings and live and tape performances by a wide variety of figures, including Ginsberg, Adrian Mitchell, Alexander Trocchi, Harry Fainlight, Anselm Hollo, Christopher Logue, George Macbeth, Gregory Corso, Lawrence Ferlinghetti, Michael Horovitz, Simon Vinkenoog, Spike Hawkins and Tom McGrath.\\\\n\\', \\'\\\\n\\', \\'Peter Whitehead documented the event on film and released it as Wholly Communion. A book featuring images from the film and some of the poems that were performed was also published under the same title by Lorrimer in the UK and Grove Press in US.\\\\n\\', \\'\\\\n\\', \\'===Continuing literary activity===\\\\n\\', \\'Ginsberg with his partner, poet Peter Orlovsky. Photo taken in 1978\\\\n\\', \\'Though the term \"Beat\" is most accurately applied to Ginsberg and his closest friends (Corso, Orlovsky, Kerouac, Burroughs, etc.), the term \"Beat Generation\" has become associated with many of the other poets Ginsberg met and became friends with in the late 1950s and early 1960s. A key feature of this term seems to be a friendship with Ginsberg. Friendship with Kerouac or Burroughs might also apply, but both writers later strove to disassociate themselves from the name \"Beat Generation.\" Part of their dissatisfaction with the term came from the mistaken identification of Ginsberg as the leader. Ginsberg never claimed to be the leader of a movement. He claimed that many of the writers with whom he had become friends in this period shared many of the same intentions and themes. Some of these friends include: David Amram, Bob Kaufman; LeRoi Jones before he became Amiri Baraka, who, after reading \"Howl\", wrote a letter to Ginsberg on a sheet of toilet paper; Diane DiPrima; Jim Cohn; poets associated with the Black Mountain College such as Robert Creeley and Denise Levertov; poets associated with the New York School such as Frank O\\\\\\'Hara and Kenneth Koch.\\\\n\\', \\'Portrait with Bob Dylan, taken in 1975\\\\n\\', \\'Later in his life, Ginsberg formed a bridge between the beat movement of the 1950s and the hippies of the 1960s, befriending, among others, Timothy Leary, Ken Kesey, and Bob Dylan. Ginsberg gave his last public reading at Booksmith, a bookstore in the Haight Ashbury neighborhood of San Francisco, a few months before his death.

A chance encounter on a New York City street with ChÃ¶gyam Trungpa Rinpoche (they both tried to catch the same cab), a Kagyu and Nyingma Tibetan Buddhist master, led to Trungpa becoming his friend and lifelong teacher . Ginsberg helped Trungpa (and New York poet Anne Waldman) in founding the Jack Kerouac School of Disembodied Poetics at Naropa University in Boulder, Colorado. \"The Beats and Travel\" by David S. Wills \\\\n\\', \\'\\\\n\\', \\'Ginsberg was also involved with Krishnaism. He had started incorporating chanting the Hare Krishna mantra into his religious practice in the mid sixties. After learning that A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada, the founder of the Hare Krishna movement in the Western world had rented a store front in New York, he befriended him, visiting him often and suggesting publishers for his books, and a fruitful relationship began. This relationship is documented by Satsvarupa Das Goswami in his biographical account Srila Prabhupada Lilamrta. Ginsberg donated money, materials, and his reputation to help the Swami establish the first temple, and toured with him to promote his cause. \\\\n\\', \\' \\\\n\\', \\'Allen Ginsberg\\\\\\'s greeting Bhaktivedanta Swami at the San Francisco Airport. January 17, 1967Despite disagreeing with many of Bhaktivedanta Swami\\\\\\'s required prohibitions, Ginsberg often sang the Hare Krishna mantra publicly as part of his philosophy and declared that it brought a state of ecstasy. He was glad that Bhaktivedanta Swami, an authentic swami from India, was now trying to spread the chanting in America. Along with other counterculture ideologists like Timothy Leary, Gary Snyder, and Alan Watts, Ginsberg hoped to incorporate Bhaktivedanta Swami and his chanting into the hippie movement, and agreed to take part in the Mantra-Rock Dance concert and to introduce the swami to the Haight-Ashbury hippie community. (from the \"Houseboat Summit\" panel discussion, Sausalito CA. February 1967)():\\\\n\\', \\'Ginsberg: So what do you think of Swami Bhaktivedanta pleading for the acceptance of Krishna in every direction?\\\\n\\', \"Snyder: Why, it\\'s a lovely positive thing to say Krishna. It\\'s a beautiful mythology and it\\'s a beautiful practice.\\\\n\", \\'Leary: Should be encouraged.\\\\n\\', \"Ginsberg: He feels it\\'s the one uniting thing. He feels a monopolistic unitary thing about it.\\\\n\", \"Watts: I\\'ll tell you why I think he feels it. The mantras, the images of Krishna have in this culture no foul association. ... hen somebody comes in from the Orient with a new religion which hasn\\'t got any of associations in our minds, all the words are new, all the rites are new, and yet, somehow it has feeling in it, and we can get with that, you see, and we can dig that! \\\\n\", \\'\\\\n\\', \\'On January 17, 1967, Allen Ginsberg helped plan and organize a reception for Bhaktivedanta Swami at the San Francisco Airport, where fifty to a hundred hippies greeted the Swami, chanting Hare Krishna in the airport lounge with flowers in hands. Addressing speculations that he was Allen Ginsberg\\\\\\'s guru, Bhaktivedanta Swami answered a direct question in a public program, \"Are you Allen Ginsberg\\\\\\'s guru?\" by saying, \"I am nobodyâ\\\\x80\\\\x99s guru. I am everybodyâ\\\\x80\\\\x99s servant. Actually I am not even a servant; a servant of God is no ordinary thing.\" (; ) To further support and promote Bhaktivendata Swami\\\\\\'s message and chanting in San Francisco, Allen Ginsberg agreed to attend the Mantra-Rock Danceâ\\\\x80\\\\x94a musical event held at the Avalon Ballroom by the San Francisco Hare Krishna temple. It featured some leading rock bands of the time: Big Brother and the Holding Company with Janis Joplin, The Grateful Dead, and Moby Grape, who performed there along with the Hare Krishna founder Bhaktivedanta Swami and donated proceeds to the Krishna temple. Ginsberg introduced Bhaktivedanta Swami to some three thousand hippies in the audience and led the chanting of the Hare Krishna mantra. \\\\n\\', \\'\\\\n\\', \\'The Mantra-Rock Dance promotional poster featuring Allen Ginsberg along with leading rock bands.Music and chanting were both important parts of Ginsberg\\\\\\'s live delivery during poetry readings. Chowka, Peter Barry, \"This is Allen Ginsberg?\" (Interview), New Age Journal, April 1976. \"I had known Swami Bhaktivedanta and was somewhat guided by him... spiritual friend. I practiced the Hare Krishna chant, practiced it with him, sometimes in mass auditoriums and parks in the Lower East Side of New York. Actually, I\\\\\\'d been chanting it since \\\\\\'63, after coming back from India. I began chanting it, in Vancouver at a great poetry conference, for the first time in \\\\\\'63, with Duncan and Olson and everybody around, and then continued. When Bhaktivedanta arrived on the Lower East Side in \\\\\\'66 it was reinforcement for me, like \\\\\\'the reinforcements had arrived\\\\\\' from India.\" He often accompanied himself on a harmonium, and was often accompanied by a guitarist. When Ginsberg asked if he could sing a song in praise of Lord Krishna on William F. Buckley, Jr.\\\\\\'s TV show Firing Line on September 3, 1968, Buckley acceded and the poet chanted slowly as he played dolefully on a harmonium. According to Richard Brookhiser, an associate of Buckley\\\\\\'s, the host commented that it was \"the most unharried Krishna I\\\\\\'ve ever heard.\" Konigsberg, Eric, \"Buckley\\\\\\'s Urbane Debating Club: Firing Line Set a Standard For Political Discourse on TV\", The New York Times, Metro Section, p B1, February 29, 2008. \\\\n\\', \\'\\\\n\\', \\'At the 1967 Human Be-In in San Francisco\\\\\\'s Golden Gate Park, the 1968 Democratic National Convention in Chicago, and the 1970 Black Panther rally at Yale campus Allen chanted \"Om\" repeatedly over a sound system for hours on end.

The song appears on the 1982 album Combat Rock by British first wave punk band The Clash.\\\\n\\', \\'\\\\n\\', \\'Ginsberg came in touch with the Hungryalist poets of Bengal, especially Malay Roy Choudhury, who introduced Ginsberg to the three fishes with one head of Indian emperor Jalaluddin Mohammad Akbar.
